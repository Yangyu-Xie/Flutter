This is the first project I learned about Flutter.

Flutter is a powerful language as it has the ability to use one single language to publish same app to different platforms.

The first thing I learned is that everything is made of "Widgets" in flutter.

This app implemnt the material design of goole, below are some sample codes I learned:

void main{ runApp( $APP_NAME_or_CLASS_NAME ($ROOT_WIDGET) )}
MaterialApp(home: $WIDGETS) A instance of Class MaterialApp, that spscifies the property named "home"
Center(child: $WIDGETS) A object of widget class, that specidying the "child" Property, this child property also expect Widgets.
Scaffold(appBar:$WIDGET,backgroundcolor:Colors.$SELECTEDCOLOR,body:$WIDGET,)

I learned that the structure of the flutter app is very similar to a html tree structure.
